# Phoenix AI Companion Toy - Architecture Guide

## Application Purpose

The Phoenix is a bouncy ball and an interactive, smart, beautiful AI-powered companion and toy for children. It provides emotional, social, and cognitive engagement and support via dynamic nurturing mechanics, guided play, tutoring, and wellness practices. This app is the Phoenix's software, designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi embedded in the ball.

Key capabilities include:
- Starting activities via wake word and intent detection
- AI voice chat and interaction via an LLM and speech recognition/synthesis
- Physical touch sensing with stroking and purring responses
- Adaptive personalization based on interaction patterns
- Location awareness via Bluetooth beacon tracking
- Various activity modes (conversation, hide & seek, scavenger hunt, movement play, cuddling, music, sleep, and phone calls)
- LED patterns for visual feedback
- Audio effects and voice responses

## Architectural Approach

### Service-Based Architecture

The Phoenix application is built on an event-driven, service-based architecture with the following key characteristics:

1. **Service Manager**: A central service manager coordinates all services, handling event distribution and service lifecycle management.

2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate asynchronously through a publish/subscribe event system. Each service can publish events that others subscribe to, enabling loose coupling between components.

3. **Shared Global State**: A centralized `GlobalState` object, managed by the `ServiceManager`, maintains key application state information (e.g., conversation status, location, sensor readings). Services can access this state without direct coupling, ensuring a single source of truth.

4. **Activity-Based Orchestration**: The system uses an activity-based approach where different modes (e.g., conversation, sleep) are represented as activities that coordinate specific services they require.

5. **Asynchronous Operation**: Built using Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking, concurrent execution of services.

### Global State Management
A key component of the architecture is the `GlobalState` object found in `src/services/service.py`. This object serves as a centralized, in-memory database for the application's real-time status. The `ServiceManager` is responsible for updating this state in response to specific events, and all services have read-only access to it. This design decouples services from one another, as they no longer need to communicate directly to query state.

### Activity Lifecycle Management
The `ActivityService` (`src/services/activity_service.py`) is the orchestrator for all user-facing modes of operation. Its logic is governed by two key components:

1.  **`ACTIVITY_REQUIREMENTS` Dictionary**: This dictionary maps each `ActivityType` to the specific supporting services it needs to run. For example, the `MOVE` activity requires the `accelerometer` service.
2.  **Transition Queue**: To prevent race conditions and ensure smooth transitions, the `ActivityService` uses an asynchronous queue to process one activity change at a time. When an event triggers a change (e.g., an `intent_detected` event), the new activity is added to the queue and processed in order.

### Event System

The application uses a publish/subscribe event system where services can publish events and subscribe to events from other services. Events are the primary method of communication between services and are used to coordinate activities, report state changes, and trigger actions.

#### Event Types

Below is a comprehensive list of events used throughout the system. Note that the `ServiceManager` is a primary consumer for many events, as it updates the `GlobalState` object.

### Manager Layer

The `src/managers/` directory contains lower-level managers that interface with specific hardware or external APIs:

- Managers for speech processing
- Location and BLE beacon handling
- Hardware interfaces and drivers

### Utility Layer

The `src/utils/` directory contains shared utilities and helper functions used across the application.

## Data Flow

1. **Startup Flow**:
   - Application initializes the service manager
   - Core services are started in dependency order
   - Initial activity (typically sleep mode) is triggered

2. **Interaction Flow**:
   - Wake word detection triggers intent service
   - Intent detection determines user's desired activity
   - Activity service queues a transition to the appropriate activity
   - The activity starts its required services (e.g., `location`, `accelerometer`)
   - Services communicate via events to respond to user actions and update global state

3. **State Management**:
   - The `GlobalState` object tracks key information. The `ServiceManager` updates the state based on events, and services can access the latest state. Example state fields:
     - `current_location`
     - `conversation_active`

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

The application is designed to run on:
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (primary target for the physical toy)
- macOS (for development and testing)

Platform-specific code is isolated and controlled via configuration settings to enable development on both platforms.

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. Determine if the feature requires a new service or can be integrated into an existing one
2. If creating a new service:
   - Inherit from `BaseService`
   - Implement `start()`, `stop()`, and `handle_event()` methods
   - Register event subscribers in the `start()` method

3. If creating a new activity:
   - Add the activity type to `ActivityType` enum in `activity_service.py`
   - Define required services in the `ACTIVITY_REQUIREMENTS` dictionary
   - Implement activity-specific service for complex activities

### Event Handling

Events should follow a standardized structure:
```python
{
    "type": "event_name",
    "producer_name": "service_name",  # Service that produced the event
    "data": {  # Optional additional data
        # Event-specific information
    }
}
```

### Configuration

All configuration should be defined in `config.py` using class-based organization for related settings.

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi embedded in the Phoenix toy. Installation can be performed using the `install.sh` script that handles dependencies and environment setup.

## API Keys and Security

The application requires several API keys to function:
- VAPI API key for voice AI
- Picovoice access key for wake word detection
- Twilio API key for PSTN calling
- ElevenLabs API key for Text-to-Speech
- OpenAI API key (optional) for alternative intent detection

These keys should be specified in the `.env` file which is not committed to version control. The `pyproject.toml` file is currently unused.

## Future Optimizations

### Power Management with Dedicated MCU

-   **TODO**: For ultimate power savings in sleep mode, a future architecture could incorporate a dedicated low-power microcontroller (MCU) like the `ESP32-S3`. This MCU's sole responsibility would be to run the wake-word engine. Upon detecting the wake word, it would then power on the Raspberry Pi to handle the more complex application logic. This would allow the Pi to be completely powered off during idle periods, extending battery life significantly.
