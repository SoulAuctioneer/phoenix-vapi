Put it in dock in lab (or see below, there’s already a pea in there)
It’s asleep. At some point actor will say “magic pea, can you hear us?”, triggering the waking-up-energy activity.  Pea will get brighter with more and more sound, until it’s fully energized and wakes up, starting a conversation with some scripted words. 
PEA #1 - (conversational pea) - In the lab room. This Pea is lying in the dock (so it can keep charged). Its relaxing after its long journey from space. We ask everyone to be very quiet. And the pea says a couple of scripted things. We then find a way to turn off the pea so the actor can continue speaking with the people in the room.
Magic pea needs is told to go to sleep, then it stops chatting. 
Then dance with bluetooth pea in botany lab.
Then scavenger hunt, groups of 10.
Then finale: Mother pea voice recording says “Hey magic peas, don’t be afraid” or something, that’s the trigger phrase for an activity where they respond: “Hello mummy!” and they light up. (ensure no need for internet).

Need:
3 fake peas - just lights (LED juggling balls with fur coat).
1 bluetooth speaker pea - bluetooth speaker in a shell (maybe add some balloon lights).
1 real conversational pea. Full functionality, will be docked.
2 real peas - for scavenger hunt - no LEDs.
3 backup real peas.
6 Bluetooth beacons (plus a couple of backups).
6 docks - or just enough docks for peas that will be visible, put the rest on charging cables.
To do:
Add 30-second SFX/giggles intro to plant growy song, for actor to find responses, chop shorter and cute, and add some giggles.
Create docks - pea-pod shaped?
To Confirm:
We will have solid WiFi in the Lab.
For the music: Add 20 seconds of discovery figuring out how the pea responds, effects on beat, responding a bit harder each time. Lil bit of trumpet, lil bit of beats, mostly giggles and chuckles. Then we do the full initial verse while kids play with the pea, then go into the lull.
