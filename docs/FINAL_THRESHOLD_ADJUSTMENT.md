# Final Threshold Adjustment - Eliminating Remaining Oscillation

## Problem Analysis from Real-World Testing

After implementing the anti-oscillation fix, testing revealed that even when the device is "completely stationary" on a table, there's still natural sensor noise that causes boundary oscillation:

### Observed Sensor Noise (Device Completely Still):
- **Linear acceleration**: 0.01-0.048 m/s²
- **Gyroscope**: 0.000-0.029 rad/s
- **Pattern**: Values fluctuate right at the threshold boundaries

### Previous Thresholds (Too Restrictive):
```python
# These were too close to natural sensor noise
stationary_linear_accel_max = 0.06   # Just above 0.048 observed max
stationary_gyro_max = 0.04           # Just above 0.029 observed max
```

### Oscillation Pattern Observed:
```
STATIONARY → HELD_STILL (when noise spike: 0.286 m/s², 0.038 rad/s)
HELD_STILL → STATIONARY (when noise settles: 0.017-0.048 m/s², 0.029 rad/s)
```

## Final Solution - Adjusted STATIONARY Thresholds

### New Thresholds (Accommodate Natural Sensor Noise):
```python
# STATIONARY: Device completely still - Account for sensor noise
stationary_linear_accel_max = 0.08   # m/s² - Above observed max (0.048) with margin
stationary_gyro_max = 0.05           # rad/s - Above observed max (0.029) with margin

# HELD_STILL: Device held by hand - Unchanged (large gap maintained)
held_still_linear_accel_max = 1.5    # m/s² - Large gap above observed 0.47 max
held_still_gyro_max = 0.50           # rad/s - More permissive for hand tremor

# Hysteresis: Unchanged (strong separation)
hysteresis_factor = 4.0              # Creates large exit thresholds
```

## Expected Behavior with New Thresholds

### Threshold Matrix:
| Current State | Linear Accel Range | Gyro Range | Exit Threshold |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| **STATIONARY** | Must stay < 0.08 | Must stay < 0.05 | Exit: > 0.32 (0.08×4) |
| **HELD_STILL** | Must stay < 1.5 | Must stay < 0.50 | Exit: > 6.0 (1.5×4) |

### Real-World Mapping:
- **0.01-0.048 m/s² (observed "completely still")** → **STATIONARY** (stable)
- **0.05-0.47 m/s² (observed "holding steady")** → **HELD_STILL** (stable)
- **> 1.5 m/s² (clear movement)** → **MOVING**

## Validation Scenarios

### ✅ Test Case 1: Device on Table (Completely Still)
**Sensor Values**: 0.01-0.048 m/s² linear, 0.000-0.029 rad/s gyro
**Expected**: **STATIONARY** (stable, no oscillation)
**Reason**: All values well below 0.08/0.05 thresholds

### ✅ Test Case 2: Device Held by Hand
**Sensor Values**: 0.05-0.47 m/s² linear, 0.015-0.099 rad/s gyro  
**Expected**: **HELD_STILL** (stable, no oscillation)
**Reason**: Values above STATIONARY but below HELD_STILL thresholds

### ✅ Test Case 3: Transition Stability
**STATIONARY Exit**: Requires > 0.32 m/s² (4x hysteresis)
**HELD_STILL Exit**: Requires > 6.0 m/s² (4x hysteresis)
**Expected**: Very stable, no false transitions

## Technical Rationale

### Why 0.08 m/s² for STATIONARY Linear Threshold:
- Observed maximum when completely still: 0.048 m/s²
- Safety margin: +67% (0.048 → 0.08)
- Hysteresis exit threshold: 0.32 m/s² (well above hand-holding noise)

### Why 0.05 rad/s for STATIONARY Gyro Threshold:
- Observed maximum when completely still: 0.029 rad/s
- Safety margin: +72% (0.029 → 0.05)
- Hysteresis exit threshold: 0.20 rad/s (well above hand-holding noise)

### Large Gap Maintained:
- STATIONARY → HELD_STILL gap: 0.08 → 1.5 m/s² (18.75x difference)
- Prevents any boundary oscillation between these states

## Expected Results

### Performance:
- ✅ **Zero oscillation** when device is completely stationary
- ✅ **Zero oscillation** when device is held steady by hand
- ✅ **Stable state detection** with appropriate 2-second transition delays
- ✅ **Accurate motion detection** for safety applications

### Debug Output:
```bash
# Expected - completely stable
DEBUG - State change: UNKNOWN → STATIONARY
[... thousands of samples with STATIONARY, no state changes ...]

# No more rapid STATIONARY ↔ HELD_STILL oscillation
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/managers/accelerometer_manager.py`**:
   - `stationary_linear_accel_max`: 0.06 → 0.08 m/s²
   - `stationary_gyro_max`: 0.04 → 0.05 rad/s
   - Added comment about accommodating observed sensor noise

2. **`debug_freefall_ultra_optimized.py`**:
   - Updated threshold display message
   - Shows new STATIONARY thresholds

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **Complete stability** when device sits on table (STATIONARY state)
- ✅ **Complete stability** when device held by hand (HELD_STILL state)  
- ✅ **No false transitions** due to sensor noise
- ✅ **Responsive but stable** transitions with 2-second delays
- ✅ **Accurate free fall detection** unaffected by state detection changes

This final adjustment should completely eliminate the remaining oscillation by properly accounting for the natural sensor noise observed in real-world testing.
